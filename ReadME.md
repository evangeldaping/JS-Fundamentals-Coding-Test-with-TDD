## Instructions for where and how to write the code

-   There is a designated are where you should write your code, it should be after the comment: Code here
-   You are at no point allowed to modify any files under the \__test_ directory

## How to run test

-   After cloning this repository type `npm install` to install the necessary packages.
-   to run all test type in the command line `npm test`.
-   Ideally, we would want to test only a single file associated with the problem we are trying to solve, to run the test type `npm test -- <nameOfFile>` and then run. For example, I want to run the test for sample.test.js I would type this in the terminal `npm test -- sample.test.js`
